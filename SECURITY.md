# Security Policy

## Supported versions

We support security fixes for the latest published version on npm.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately via GitHub Security Advisories:

- https://github.com/t54-labs/clawcredit-blockrun-gateway/security/advisories/new

If that link is unavailable for your account, open a private channel with maintainers and include:

- affected version
- reproduction steps
- impact assessment
- proposed fix (optional)

## Response expectations

- Initial triage target: within 3 business days
- Mitigation/fix target: based on severity and exploitability

## Security best practices for users

- Treat `CLAWCREDIT_API_TOKEN` as a secret.
- Do not paste raw production logs with sensitive headers.
- Rotate tokens when compromise is suspected.
